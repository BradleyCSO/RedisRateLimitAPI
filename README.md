# Introduction
This project is a minimal API, built using [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/dotnet/8.0) and has a single responsibility of rate limiting certain endpoints, defined in the `rate-limits.json`, for any API that consumes it. An example of it being consumed can be found at the following [repository](https://github.com/BradleyCSO/redis-cache-with-rate-limiting-api).
